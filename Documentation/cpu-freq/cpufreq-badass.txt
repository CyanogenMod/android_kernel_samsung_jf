The Badass CPU Governor

This governor is intended to have good responsiveness while maintaining
good battery life.

This does it in two ways:
	- 2 and 3 phase Algorithms (requires Board File hooks)
	- GPU Control Algorithm (requires GPU Driver hooks)

To be the most effective, it must be tuned.

To tune the 2 and 3 phase freqs:
	- The 2 Phase Freq is about 66% of the Max CPU Clock
	- The 3 Phase Freq is about 75% of the Max CPU Clock

To tune the GPU Control Algorithm:
	- The Semi Busy Threshold is about 95-100% of the Max GPU Clock
	- The Semi Busy Clear Threshold is about 66% of the Max GPU Clock
	- The Busy Threshold is about about 263-266% of the Max GPU Clock
	- The Busy Clear Threshold is about 1s about 188% of the Max GPU Clock

IMPORTANT: Not tuning the 2 and 3 phase freqs can cause huge lag, and 
           not tuning the GPU Control Algorithm can cause very noticable
           micro lag while using the phone.
