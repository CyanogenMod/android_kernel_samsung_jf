	  register does not exist or is inaccessible due to security
	  restrictions or (in some cases) clock configuration. Enabling this
	  option will cause a backtrace to be printed to the kernel log whenever
	  such an error is encountered. Note that the error is reported as an
	  interrupt rather than as an exception, meaning that the backtrace may
	  have some skid. This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

	  which attempt to access bad areas of the address space, or access
	  hardware registers in an improper state (such as certain clocks not
	  being on). This option may help with debugging, though production
	  builds should probably say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_1BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on recoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a single-bit (correctable) soft error. This option should
	  only be enabled when doing low-level debugging where cache corruption
	  is suspected.

	  For production builds, you should definitely say 'N' here.

config MSM_L2_ERP_2BIT_PANIC
	bool "Panic on unrecoverable L2 soft errors"
	depends on MSM_CACHE_ERP
	help
	  Enable this option to cause a kernel panic whenever the L2 cache
	  encounters a double-bit (non-correctable) soft error. Debug builds
	  will likely benefit from having this option enabled to catch cache
	  problems as soon as possible.

	  For production builds, it may be acceptable to say 'N' here, since
	  an uncorrectable error might not necessarily cause further problems.

config MSM_DCVS
